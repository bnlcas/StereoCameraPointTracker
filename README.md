#StereoCameraPointTracker

OpenFrameworks application to track the position of a single disturbance entering into a region of space. 
This application takes video data streams from two camera and identifies the single most prominent change from a baseline measurement. 
This information then used to calculate the position of the disturbance and render graphics related to this action.
